                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <h4>Overview</h4>
                <p>Hello! My name is Jamie Bryson. I am currently 26 years old, live in Charlotte, North Carolina, and have lived in this area for the majority of my life. The only time I have spent a significant amount of time elsewhere was when I was going to college at the University of South Carolina (Go Gamecocks!). I spent 2016-2020 there getting my B.S. in Biological Sciences. After that, I stayed in town for about 2.5 year working in an environmental science lab. In early 2023, I moved back to Charlotte and started working for an electrical engineering company. This company has a lot of opportunities for vertial and lateral growth. Some of the lateral growth includes coding opportunities which has led me to taking this class!</p>
                <h4>Skills</h4>
                <ul>
